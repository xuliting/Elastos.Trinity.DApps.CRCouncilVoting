# About

This is the official CRC Election App of elastOS. Users of the Elastos community can take part in electing candidates to the Cyber Republic Council, helping democratize the new internet. Voting power is determined by the user's ELA balance which is fetched from the elastOS wallet. 1 ELA = 1 vote, the more ELA a user owns, the more their voice is heard.
